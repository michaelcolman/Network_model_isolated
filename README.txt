This is an isolated and simple implementation of the network model in 2D and 3D.

This implementation is designed to be extracted and placed within whatever code you chose, rather than imeplemtned as is. For example, there is no parallelisation. 

The cell model is a minimal one and is provided mainly such that the code will run and give you something to compare your implementation to / to test this. 

Please feel free to use as you like!
